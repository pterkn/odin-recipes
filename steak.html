    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This 20-minute recipe is done on the stovetop in one pan (no need to finish it in the oven).
        This is one of our favorite steak recipes because it's a quick
        and convenient cooking method. The garlic butter elevates this dish to a different level!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 Rib-Eye Steaks</li>
        <li>Garlic Butter</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Rosemary</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Pat dry</strong> - use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil
            splatter.</li>
        <li><strong>Season generously</strong> - just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and
            pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the pan</strong> on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sear steaks</strong> - add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then
            use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
        <li><strong>Add butter and aromatics</strong> - melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs.
            Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).</li>
        <li><strong>Remove steak</strong> and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
    </ol>
